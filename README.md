# QR-Code-Generator
 Create a QR Code for Links 


This script creates a window with an entry field, a label to display the QR code, and two buttons. 
When you press the "Generate QR Code" button, it generates a QR code from the text in the entry field and displays it on the label. 
When you press the "Save QR Code" button, it opens a file dialog where you can choose where to save the QR code image.

If it dosn't work need to install the following Lib:
- Pillow 
- QRcode
like this in the Terminal:

pip install qrcode

pip install Pillow
